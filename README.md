# Instagram Unliker

A simple browser console script to automatically unlike posts on Instagram in bulk. This script automates the process of selecting and unliking posts from your activity page.


[!IMPORTANT]
> - **UI Language Must Be English:** For the script to find the correct buttons ("Select", "Unlike"), you must set your Instagram account's language to English.
> - **Use at Your Own Risk:** This script interacts directly with the Instagram website's code. If Instagram updates its website, this script may stop working or cause unexpected behavior.

## How to Use

1.  Go to your "Likes" activity page on Instagram:
    **https://www.instagram.com/your_activity/interactions/likes/**

2.  Make sure your Instagram interface language is set to **English**.

3.  Open the developer console in your web browser:
    - **Chrome/Firefox:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Option+J` (Mac)
    - **Safari:** Enable the Develop menu in Safari's Advanced preferences, then press `Cmd+Option+C`

4.  Copy the entire content of the `unlike.js` script.

5.  Paste the script into the console and press **Enter** to run it. The script will start unliking posts automatically.
